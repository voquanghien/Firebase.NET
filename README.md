# Firebase.NET
Client library for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) written in C# / .NET.

This library provides a simple way in pure C# to send messages using the FCM HTTP connection servers. All JSON serialization/deserialization and HTTP related stuff is done automatically.

I just modified this lib for framework .NET 4.0.
